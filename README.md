# Digit Classifier

This project is a digit classifier implemented in PyTorch. It uses the MNIST dataset to train a neural network to recognize handwritten digits.

## Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `DataLoader.py`: Contains code for loading the MNIST dataset.
- `Digit_classifier.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that trains and evaluates the Machine Learning model.
- `Digit_classifier.pth`: The trained model weights.
- `GUI.py`: A graphical user interface for testing the digit classifier.
- `data/MNIST/`: The MNIST dataset.

## Usage

To use this project, first install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then run the GUI:
